This is a basic algorithm using K-Nearest-Neighbor.

The data from the .data file has been formatted for use using preprocessing.

Altering the number of neighbors used on line 28 will affect your results in interesting ways. 
Though after a few runs I have found 9 to be the optimal number for accuracy.
Altering the number on line 40 will indicate the distance between the point used and 'k', the number of closest points.

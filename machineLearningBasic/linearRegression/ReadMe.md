This is a basic linear regression machine learning file.

It is designed to train an algorithm to predict information given other information, 
and to then plot this information onto a graph. 

By changing the "predict" value, and/or the data values, different variations
of the algorithm can be trained. You can also alter the range to change how long the algorithm is trained for.
